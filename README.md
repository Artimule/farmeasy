# FarmEasy
In India, the majority of the population is dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. <br>
Many new technologies, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are being implemented into agriculture <br>
so that it is easier for farmers to grow and maximize their yield.<br>
This project presents the idea that how we can use ML/DL in precision farming if developed at a large scale <br>
and with authentic and verified data.
